- **Simple CLI Interface:** No complicated GUIs or bloat‚Äîjust clean and clear command-line commands.

| Option        | Description                                            | Example            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `--search`    | Text to search for in filenames                        | `--search old`     |
| `--replace`   | Text to replace the search string with                 | `--replace new`    |

## Examples

* **Replace ‚Äúdraft‚Äù with ‚Äúfinal‚Äù in all filenames:**

```bash
python bulk_rename.py ./my_files --search draft --replace final
```

* **Add prefix ‚Äú2025\_‚Äù to all files:**

```bash
python bulk_rename.py ./my_files --prefix 2025_
```

* **Add suffix ‚Äú\_backup‚Äù to all `.txt` files, without renaming yet (dry run):**

```bash
python bulk_rename.py ./my_files --suffix _backup --extension .txt --dry-run
```

---

## How It Works üîß

The script scans the target folder, lists all files, optionally filters them by extension, then applies:

* Search & replace on the filename string
* Prefix addition
* Suffix addition (before extension)

All changes are previewed in dry-run mode or committed by renaming files using `os.rename()`.

## Who Is This For?

* **Photographers:** Rename photo batches by date or event name.
* **Writers & Editors:** Replace draft tags in manuscripts with final versions.
* **Developers:** Clean up messy file names or add project-specific prefixes.
* **Content Managers:** Organize files before uploading or archiving.

If you handle **lots of files** and want a **reliable and fast way** to rename them, this tool is for you.
